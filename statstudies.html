  <h1>Statistical Project: Learning Styles and Grades</h1>
  <h2> <u>Abstract</u></h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to investigate the relationship between learning styles and academic grades
    among students. Recall that commonly accepted learning styles include: visual, auditory,
    read/write, kinesthetic.
    The study examines whether the implementation of 10-minute quizzes in each class improves grades for different learning style categories. 
    The research utilizes statistical analysis techniques to explore the data and draw meaningful conclusions.
  </p>

  <br></br>
  <h2><u>Introduction </u></h2>
  <p>

Welcome to our exciting project! Our mission is to explore the fascinating relationship between learning styles and academic grades among students.
<img src="tqz.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;padding:10px " align="right">
In the world of education, we're curious to know if injecting some extra fun into the classroom can positively impact those grades. Our idea is to introduce 10-minute quizzes during each class, but here's the real kicker – we want to determine if these quizzes have varying effects on students with different learning styles. It's like conducting a grand experiment in the realm of learning! To make sense of all the data we gather, we'll be utilizing statistical analysis techniques to draw meaningful conclusions. 

Let's figure out once and for all if Mr/Mrs. so-and-so was right to torture us with those quizzes
afterall!

  </p>

  <br></br>
  <h2><u>Data Collection</u></h2>
  <p>
  The dataset consists of information <a href="datacoll.html"> collected </a> from a sample of students, including their
    learning style category ( colleted by administering VARK questionaires), previous grades, and new grades
    after the implementation of 10-minute quizzes. The data was collected through surveys and
    classroom assessments over a semester of personal client tutoring. 
    I recorded the data by entering it in excel. Then I converted the data into a pandas dataframe
    and it is this format that I worked with. 
    
  </p>

  <br></br>
  <h2> <u>Data Analysis</u></h2>
  <p>
    The analysis begins with descriptive statistics to provide an overview of the dataset. It includes measures such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions for the variables of interest. Subsequently, the data is grouped based on learning style categories using Python and the Pandas library.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hypothesis testing is conducted to assess the impact of the 10-minute quizzes on grades within each learning style category. The statistical analysis includes paired t-tests to compare the previous grades with the new grades for each group. The significance level is set at α = 0.05.
  </p>

  <br></br>
  <h2><u>Results</u></h2>
  <p>
    The analysis revealed that the implementation of 10-minute quizzes had no statistically significant effect on grades for the Visual learning style category (t-statistic = 0.294, p-value = 0.772). However, it is important to note that this finding may be subject to certain limitations, such as sample size and potential confounding variables.
  </p>

  <br></br>
  <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
  <p>
    The results suggest that the implementation of 10-minute quizzes did not have a significant impact on grades for the Visual learning style category. Further research with larger sample sizes, longer study durations, and consideration of additional variables is recommended to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between learning styles and grades.
